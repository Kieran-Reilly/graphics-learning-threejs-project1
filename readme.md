# "Hello World" Starter Project

This is a simple "hello-world" started project following the [Three.js Fundamentals Tutorial](https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-fundamentals.html).

Within this project, I'll be looking to replicate the spinning cubes found in the tutorial above, to begin getting to gribs with the core fundamentals of three.js
